    <p>After the imprisonment of his mother, Marcie, Worm is left to his own devices with his son Dixon. As they see themselves helpless and in debt, Worm decides on a plan to rob Stanley, the quiz kid. The opportunity arises at the Lamplighter, but something happens and the plan doesnâ€™t go as expected. What was supposed to be a simple robbery becomes the path to his redemption and to the forgiving of his sins. The moment to release the future from death, free from the shadows of the past at last.</p>
