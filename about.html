    <h1>About</h1>    
    <p>Welcome to For the Sake of Momentum, the moment where the lives of 4 people collide. The fiction, based on Magnolia by Paul Thomas Anderson, follows Marcie, her son Worm, his son Dixon and the quiz show kid Stanley. As they live their lives in the San Fernando Valley all the loose ends left in Magnolia get tied. </p> <br>
    <h3>The Beginning</h3>
    <p>All the stories in Magnolia fit a very defined causality system, because a character did something, something else with very clear consequences is happening right now. All but one.<br><br> 
    When we first meet Jim, the policeman, we follow him as he gets ready for work and gets his first call of the day. That’s when we are introduced to Marcie. We learn someone was killed in her apartment. Later when she is getting interrogated the detectives keep asking about her son, we never meet him, but there’s the underlying implication that he was the murderer.<br> 
    As Jim exits the scene a boy intercepts him, we meet Dixon, who clearly knows something about what happened there. He tries to tell the man what he knows through a rap song we can’t quite decipher. And all throughout the film we see scenes of Dixon interacting with a man we might assume is his father. The man picking him up, the man running from Jim and Dixon stealing his gun. Which appears out of nowhere, later at the end of the film.<br><br>

    Parallel to this storyline, we follow the journey of Stanley as he is humiliated on live television and runs away from the TV set. Later as frogs rain from the sky, we see him at the school library, but we never get to see his journey there or why he decided to go there.

    <h3>The Fiction</h3>    
    <p>For the Sake of Momentum fills the gap Magnolia leaves unexplored, giving an ending to the storyline that is left unconcluded on the original film. Introducing Worm, Marcie’s son and Dixon’s father, the character we never meet and giving back story to the motivations and tribulations of those characters. <br> <br>

    The fiction takes place in two separate spaces. At a prison cell, where Marcie is, and at the Lamplighter, a café. Where the other three characters meet and interact. Stanley, who never ends up making it to the school library, sits alone in a booth, when he is interrupted by a man. What starts as a simple robbery becomes something else entirely different.
